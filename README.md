# superSimpleMCBackup
A very simple Minecraft server backup script.  

This script is intended to be a very basic tool, and as such lacks a lot of advanced features such as putting the server into read-only mode, and automatic removal of older backups.  Feel free to build upon this as a foundation.

Heavily commented to help in use as a learning tool or reference.
